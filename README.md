## Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SatuPadu/fses_backend.git
cd fses_backend
```

## Setup with Docker

## Build and Run Docker Containers

Setup your .env file and then build the Docker image and start the container using the following command:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker image and start a container exposing the application on port 8080.

## Access the Container

To interact with the application inside the Docker container, use:

```sh
docker exec -it fses_backend bash
```

This will give you access to the containerâ€™s shell.

## Run Migrations and Seeders

Inside the container, run the following commands to install composer, migrate and seed the database:

```sh
composer install
php artisan migrate --seed
```
## Start the queue

Inside the container, run the following commands to start the queue service. It will allow to send emails and import files:

```sh
php artisan queue:work
```

<!-- ## Run Tests

To run the tests, use:

```sh
php artisan test
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the application. -->

<!-- ## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger. 

Being inside the container run the following command:

```bash
php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```

Now you can access it via the following URL once the application is running:

```sh
http://localhost:8080/api/documentation
``` -->

Notes
	â€¢	Ensure the .env file is correctly configured for database and other settings before running the application.
	â€¢	Modify the exposed ports in the docker run command if 8080 is already in use on your system.
