## Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SatuPadu/fses_backend.git
cd fses_backend
```

## Setup with Docker

## Build and Run Docker Containers

Setup your .env file and then build the Docker image and start the container using the following command:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This will build the Docker image and start a container exposing the application on port 8080.

## Access the Container

To interact with the application inside the Docker container, use:

```sh
docker exec -it fses_backend bash
```

This will give you access to the containerâ€™s shell.

## Run Migrations and Seeders

Inside the container, run the following commands to install composer, migrate and seed the database:

```sh
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```

## Run Scheduler and Queue Worker

### Run Scheduler

The Laravel scheduler can be executed now. This will fetch the articles form The Guardian, News API and the New York TImes. Using the following command inside the container you can aggregate the articles. Setup your .env with the proper keys before you proceed:

```sh
php artisan schedule:run
```

To run it continuously, consider setting up a cron job.

### Run Queue Worker

Run the queue worker to process background jobs:

```sh
php artisan queue:work
```

## Run Tests

To run the tests, use:

```sh
php artisan test
```

This will execute all the test cases defined in the application.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger. 

Being inside the container run the following command:

```bash
php artisan l5-swagger:generate
```

Now you can access it via the following URL once the application is running:

```sh
http://localhost:8080/api/documentation
```

Notes
	â€¢	Ensure the .env file is correctly configured for database and other settings before running the application.
	â€¢	Modify the exposed ports in the docker run command if 8080 is already in use on your system.
